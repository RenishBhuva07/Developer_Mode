                    <p>
                        &diams; Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most
                        commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side
                        script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted
                        programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &diams; JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to
                        JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript
                        made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript.

                        &diams;
                        <b>Defination:</b>
                        isNaN() returns true if a number is Not-a-Number. In other words: isNaN() converts the value to
                        a
                        number before testing it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &diams;
                        <b>Usage:</b>
                        The isNaN() function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It
                        returns
                        true if value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.

                        &diams;
                        NEGATIVE_INFINITY is the same as the negative value of the global object's Infinity property.
                        This
                        value behaves slightly differently than mathematical infinity: Any positive value, including
                        POSITIVE_INFINITY , multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NEGATIVE_INFINITY.

                        1995. It took Eich only 10 days to develop the scripting language, then known as Mocha.

                        client's end, making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the
                        server's end, making it easy to manage content from this end too. ViewState: It is maintained at
                        only one level that is page-level.

                <blockquote>
                    &diams; The strict equality operator (===) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a
                    Boolean
                    result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of
                    different types to be different.
